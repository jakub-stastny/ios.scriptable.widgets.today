# Today widget

## Setting up time frames

See `src/schedule.ts`.

## Calendar workflow

In calendar `Time frames`:

- Main task of the day is the _only_ full day event. If there is no current time frame, this main time frame is taken.
- Scheduled tasks carry their timeframe in the title, such as `Project: task #timeframe`
