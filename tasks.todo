- Main: get the coming time frame and show minutes remaining.
- Evening: consider switching to tomorrow view(?) Or just show an image of a candle light.
- Research calendar apps with better support for URL schemes.
- Unit tests.
- Extract out the timeframes library.
- Consider making time frame colours configurable (type: 'currentEvent', main already has got its red colour).
- Make timezones configurable (pass {PRG: "Europe/Prague"} as `args.widgetParameter`).
